# Taxonomy select

An taxonomy select is used for filter forms. It consists of a series of govukSelect components which are wrapped by a collapsing/expanding element.

It is based heavily on the Finder app's taxon select: https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/blob/master/app/views/finders/_taxon_facet.html.erb
